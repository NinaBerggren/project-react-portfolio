# React Portfolio
Updated/New version of my portfolio using React and styled-components. 

## The problem
I created my own JSON files for maping my projects under featured and other projects. I structured the website in components and decided what could be reused as global styles and worked through each section of the site. 
Not compleatly finished, imges in Featured project not showing.
If I hade more time I go trough each component to stremline with Global-styling eaven more. I would like to try the Github API.
